## Mochifu No Terepasu
What is Mochitere? Mochitere is derived from the extended term “Mochifu No Terepasu”, or “theme of passing”. In essence it is literary style that seeks to use classical literary devices like Confessional Novel, in order to tell a story that’s a blend of true crime, dystopian, and slice of life. It can at times overlap with Cyberpunk, but differs from Cyberpunk in that rather than focusing on virtual reality, it seems more subliminal approaches with technology to make you feel extremely strange.

It can be seen as the technological equivalent to seeing sets of three in the world around you, in advertising and everywhere else. A common antagonist might be a girlfriend, whose actually a serial killer, a best friend whose a “brand stealer”, and other aspects that blur the line between cyberpunk, true crime fiction, and literary fiction.

For the musical equivalent, see Reve Diminuee.
