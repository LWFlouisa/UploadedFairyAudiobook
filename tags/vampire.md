title: "Clinical Vampires And Post World War III"
---
The vampire in my works of fiction differ from the supernatural vampire, in that they’re still genetically related to humans, and are not a form of the undead. But rather can be seen as shorthand for “clinical vampirism”. The first known clinical vampire was “Hemato-Tomato”, an executioner’s assistant that initially resisted her profession as North America’s headswoman for the guillotine. But eventually gave into her darker desires after the death of Ehena. But the simulation of Ehena allowed her to maintain some aspects of her humanity in part two of Uploaded Fairy.

Such “clinical vampires” generally have a sexual attraction to the sight of blood. Do to a misunderstanding of the intentions of vampires, they had been hunted in the same way official ethnic groups had been, and often some ethnic traits had vampire traits hoisted upon them. But the evidence that minorities like Jewish people had vampire traits is unfounded.

Clinical vampires became more numerous after the World War III, and the Franco-Japanese wars between French controlled North America, and Japanese controlled North America. The vampires speak a sub dialect of Ahusacos that blends Celtic Languages, some Slavic languages, and other minority languages that both the Japanese and French historically persecuted.

Vampires are often extremely technical, similar to Cyberpunk, but are generally skeptical of trending genre movements.

In reality, clinical vampires are actually more likely to be law abiding system, and are largely indistinguishable from those with high functioning autism, and overlap within the same circles. In fact, one of the few allies Vampire culture have are tech savvy autistic people.

Ehena, a half Japanese French girl, could be seen as a potential ally of Hemato-Tomato, before she found out about her profession.
