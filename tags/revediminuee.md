## Reve Diminuee
### Or "Diminished Dream"

Reve Diminuee, or “Diminished Dream”, is a style of music not quite Jazz or Classical, that focuses less on glorifying composers from historical periods, but that instead seeks a vaguely “dreamlike” quality that approaches horror, but in a way that is much less explicit than in a horror movie.

Some examples might be dreams of “feeling like your chased by an unseen something in a forest”, or wandering an unfamiliar mansion, followed by something you cannot quite understand. It can be seen as the musical equivalent to “magical realism”, but differs in that Magical Realism and Surrealism is considered a part of the literary tradition.
